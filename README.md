So this is the tool and to make it run on linux terminal do these steps:

[1] Download the files
[2] Put it somewhere where you know the path to it
[3] Execute it ( use chmod+x #path to the file )
[4] Use it 9 type in the terminal python3 Bruteforce_tool.py)
[5] Enjoouy pentesting

Btw there is a precoded file where i put some users password that I thought of
#Create your own txt file

Like this:

root
user
444

save it as list.txt
than put the path into the tool where it will ask for the path
